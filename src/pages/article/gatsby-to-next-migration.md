title: Gatsby to Next.js Migration

I migrated my blog from Gatsby to Next.js to capitalize on all of the Next.js hype, as you do. As blog custom necessitates, this is a log of that migration.

Originally I planned to rewrite my blog from scratch, using Next.js conventions from the beginning to avoid headaches. The Next.js guide, [migrating from Gatsby](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-gatsby), convinced me otherwise. Most of the items in that guide are as simple as they are stated and do not require rehashing. However, there are a few unexpected aspects to the migration that I explain in this article.

View the whole migration in [this squashed commit](https://github.com/mgmarlow/mgmarlow.com/commit/cc3ba9adf189052fb17f6a9b664ed57564c31b05) on Github.

## Markdown + Prism

Next.js describes in detail the steps to [convert from Gatsby's data fetching strategy](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-gatsby#data-fetching) with regards to rendering markdown. If you want to use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting, two extra steps are needed:

1. Global styles are moved to a custom `App` component in [`pages/_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app). This is where you import your Prism theme.

```jsx
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

2. An extra `remark` plugin, [remark-prism](https://github.com/sergioramos/remark-prism), is included in the `remark` call chain.

```js
// pages/[slug].js
import remark from 'remark'
import prism from 'remark-prism'
import html from 'remark-html'
// ...

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug)

  const markdown = await remark()
    .use(prism) // New dependency
    .use(html)
    .process(post.content || '')

  return {
    props: {
      ...post.frontmatter,
      content: markdown.toString(),
    },
  }
}
```

## Styled components

You are probably already using [Gatsby's styled-components plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/) to enable server-side rendering. Since part of the Next.js conversion is moving out of the Gatsby plugin ecosystem, you need to implement the features of this plugin manually.

Add a new file, `.babelrc`, and extend the default `next` preset:

```
yarn add babel-plugin-styled-components --dev
```

```json
// .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": [["styled-components", { "ssr": true }]]
}
```

Additionally, if you're using `createGlobalStyle` to create a theme for your application, you need to extend your app with a [custom `Document`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document).

```js
// pages/_document.js
import Document from 'next/document'
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage

    try {
      ctx.renderPage = () =>
        originalRenderPage({
          enhanceApp: (App) => (props) =>
            sheet.collectStyles(<App {...props} />),
        })

      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
      return {
        ...initialProps,
        styles: (
          <>
            {initialProps.styles}
            {sheet.getStyleElement()}
          </>
        ),
      }
    } finally {
      sheet.seal()
    }
  }
}
```

This custom [`Document`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/master/examples/with-styled-components/pages/_document.js) completes the styled-components integration.

- [`ServerStyleSheet`](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#example) is the styled-components API that enables server-side rendering (SSR). It wraps the Next.js application with a provider, making your styles available via a context API for SSR.
- [`babel-plugin-styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components) adds a unique identifier to every styled component to avoid [HTML attribute mismatches](https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#serverside-rendering).

## Github Pages deployments

One last gotcha that is well explained in [James Wallis's blog post](https://dev.to/jameswallis/deploying-a-next-js-app-to-github-pages-24pn) involves Github Pages deployments. If you're deploying a site that has its own dedicated repository, e.g. `github.com/mgmarlow/some-repo`, you need to configure Next.js's base paths to locate assets in the proper directory.

Add the following to `next.config.js`, substituting `some-repo` with the name of your respository.

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  basePath: '/some-repo',
  assetPrefix: '/some-repo/',
}
```

## Was it worth it?

Absolutely. Thanks to the [Next.js migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-gatsby), the entire process took me less than a few hours. The result is an application that is easy to understand and even easier to extend.

If nothing else, migrating to Next.js has convinced me that Gatsby's GraphQL infrastructure is over-engineered, especially for blogs. The advantages of a rich plugin ecosystem are outweighed by the sheer number of configuration files dependent on esoteric APIs.
